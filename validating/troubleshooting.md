# Troubleshooting

When deploying and configuring the DePool smart contract and running a validator node using it, you may encounter with some errors.

Most likely - this is one of these problems:

* Wrong contract version
* DePool isn't emitting events
* Validator script and election request issues
* DePool function terminates with error in TONOS-CLI

The solution for all these errors can be found in the "Troubleshooting" section of the[ TON.Dev documentation](https://docs.ton.dev/86757ecb2/p/04040b-run-depool/t/2539fe) page dedicated to Depools.
