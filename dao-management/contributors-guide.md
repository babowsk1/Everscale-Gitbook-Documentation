# ðŸ‘‰ Contributors Guide

Since Everscale was created according to the principles of decentralization, the network is managed and developed in a completely decentralized manner with the help of a community, which is divided into groups called sub-management according to industry directions. All decisions in the network are made exclusively thanks to a constantly modernizing system, where each proposal (proposal) is made on behalf of the working groups. Such a management system makes it possible to develop a network of several directions at once, motivating active members and partners of the community with competitive awards accrued in EVER.

Let's take a closer look at how you can contribute to the development of the network and earn a EVER partnership with your company.

### Contribute as an individual

As mentioned above in Everscale, there are special working groups, Subgovernence, engaged in the development of each of more than 15 areas. Anyone can become a member of one of these groups, it is enough just to show their interest and begin to freely apply their experience and skills together with other participants.

Each active subgovernance member who has contributed to the development of the network is paid a remuneration in EVER on a monthly or project basis.

Funding for Subgovernance is carried out through voting, which determines the amount of funds allocated monthly to Subgovernance from a special giver of a smart contract for its development.

You can find the list of Subgovernance and information on each of them below:

If you are highly qualified in your field and want to quickly monetize it without constantly working on the network, we recommend that you familiarize yourself with the "Contests" section, which contains a list of current contests, where anyone can take part and receive EVER:

### Offer a Everscale partnership

The partnership can be considered solely through a vote of network members. In order for your proposal to be put to a vote, it is necessary to briefly, but in fact, state it in writing in a special forum thread. After that, you will receive feedback if your proposal is accepted by the community. You can find more detailed examples of partnerships in the corresponding section:

{% endcontent-ref %}

If your project or proposal concerns the development of the DeFI network industry, you can leave your application on the [Everscale DeFI Alliance website](https://everalliance.org/en).

The Everscale community is always glad to meet new people and mutually beneficial partnerships! Learn more about the structure of the community:
