# ðŸ‘‰ Individuals Guide

## Let's start

In this section, you will find for yourself all the important information about the key opportunities in the Everscale network, as an individual user. \
Step by step, you will learn where you should start getting to know the network in order to use all the advantages of the developing Everscale blockchain as efficiently as possible.

The main token of the network is TON Crystal (ticker TON). It is used to pay commissions to validators, accrue rewards to stakeholders and participants in competitions held by the DAO management team, and also performs a number of other important functions within the network. \
Everscale has several types of tokens, the most popular of which is the TIP-3 token format, similar to ERC20.

Let's move on to the step-by-step instructions of the network participant! \
**P.S.** If you are a trader and you are not interested in farming, nft, hodl and interaction with various network protocols, then you can not waste your time and go straight to the list of **** [**crypto exchanges**](https://docs.tonalliance.org/individuals-and-institutionals/buy-sell-trade) **** that support trading with the TON Crystal token and TIP-3 format tokens.

### Buy and store

Before we look at ways to store TON purchases, you need to select and create a wallet for TON and, if necessary, TIP-3 tokens.

How do you know which wallet to choose? If you want to use all the capabilities of the network: connect to various Dapps for farming or nft, have control over your funds, be able to transfer your resources from other blockchains and a number of other actions, then we recommend that you choose a wallet from the list of web extensions:

{% content-ref url="wallets/web-wallets.md" %}
[web-wallets.md](wallets/web-wallets.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

If the speed and convenience of acquiring and storing a token are first of all important for you, and you do not plan to interact with Dapp and other products of the Everscale ecosystem, then we recommend that you choose one of the popular hot mobile or desktop wallets, which is perfect for these purposes:

{% content-ref url="wallets/mobile-wallets.md" %}
[mobile-wallets.md](wallets/mobile-wallets.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="buy-sell-trade.md" %}
[buy-sell-trade.md](buy-sell-trade.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

Also, if you already have EVER on your wallet, but you want to purchase TIP-3 tokens (USDT, USDC, CRV and others), you can use the DEX protocols:

{% content-ref url="farming-and-nft.md" %}
[farming-and-nft.md](farming-and-nft.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

### Popular cases of interaction with the network (DeFi & NFT)

At this stage, you have a web wallet with TIP-3 tokens or just EVER, which opens up a wide range of possibilities offered by various products of the Everscale ecosystem.

Today, the hottest industries in the crypto world are DeFi, NFT and blockchain gaming, and so far, in addition to gaming, you can find in Everscale:

{% content-ref url="farming-and-nft.md" %}
[farming-and-nft.md](farming-and-nft.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

P.S. There you will also find DEX, where you can buy TIP-3 tokens: USDT, USDC, CRV and others.
