### Ever Surf

Ever Surf is a free, private and simple blockchain interface that is a wallet for storing funds, as well as a built-in functional chat.

The application provides access to your account, token balance, transaction history and other activities available on the network. The wallet has not only a browser, but also a mobile version. There is also a version for testers.
