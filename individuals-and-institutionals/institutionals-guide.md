After creating your multisig wallet, you can fund it in two ways, not counting the OTC transaction:\
\
1\. Transfer your assets from other blockchains using bridge between networks

2\. Buy EVER on the exchange and withdraw it to your wallet:

{% content-ref url="buy-sell-trade.md" %}
[buy-sell-trade.md](buy-sell-trade.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}
