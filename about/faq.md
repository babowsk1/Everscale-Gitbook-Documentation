#### Why Everscale?

Everscale's architecture demonstrates that when software algorithms are implemented alongside a blockchain's infrastructure, the software itself ceases to be a performance bottleneck, thereby allowing transaction throughput to scale in direct proportion to network bandwidth.

As such, Everscale’s architecture satisfies the three fundamental properties of a blockchain: scalability, security and decentralization.

**Tell us more about documentation overview**

At Everscale we are demonstrating that distributed systems research is applicable to blockchain. Furthermore, and much to our surprise, it can be implemented using a mechanism that has been part of Bitcoin since day one:d nLocktime, which can be used to postdate transactions using block height instead of a timestamp.&#x20;

**How does Everscale differ from other platforms?**

It includes native sharding with infinite scaling capabilities, meaning that adding new validators increases the blockchain’s throughput of smart contract executions.
