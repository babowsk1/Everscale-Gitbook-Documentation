# Roadmap

The Everscale roadmap is a document summarizing the process of developing the project and its main stages leading to the final goal of establishing the Everscale project. The Everscale roadmap briefly describes three main stages of the project formation, each stage has its own name: Stage 1 "Raging Bull" - creation and testing of a stimulating decentralized beta network with fast transaction rates. At this stage, the test network is deployed, the validators, between which the initial tokens are distributed, test the main nodes of the network.

Stage 2 "Rumble Fish" - at this stage, a smart contract is executed that is designed to transfer control from the developers of the network to the validators to fully support the last beta network.

Stage 3 "Fight Club" - the deployment of a fully decentralized network. At this stage, a sufficient number of validators must be selected for the maintenance and operation of the decentralized network, tokens are distributed among the users according to a previously selected airdrop mechanism. These three stages are designed to adapt to network release, development and updating of necessary software, improvement of network security, distribution of rewards within the network, etc.

After completing the work on the foundation of the network, emphasis was placed on the active development of the network and its presentation to the crypto community.&#x20;
