# TIP-3 Tokens

TIP-3 Token is a Everscale token standard that describes the basic principles of building smart token contracts.

The TIP-3 token standard contains:

* Smart contracts of custom wallets have the right to deploy only the root smart contract from their address.
* User wallets have the same code as the root smart contract, but contain different user data.
* The TIP-3 standard also describes the basic ways of interaction of user smart contracts with each other and a mechanism for checking the type of a smart contract by its address on the blockchain.

This standard describes only the basic principles, so Everscale has created a consortium for extensions to the TIP-3 standard. The consortium registers the characteristics of the token's smart contract, after which it is stored inside the blockchain.
