# About integration

To connect Indacoin to your site, you need to use one of the provided integration methods:&#x20;

1. You can add a ready-made widget [(example) ](https://tonalliance.org)to your site.
2. Use the [Indacoin API](https://indacoin.io/api\_doc) and implement the purchase of EVER through your own interface.&#x20;

Also, you need to add the **Partnername** and **Secret** when integrating. We care about you and instead of wasting time and money on concluding your own partnership agreements, you can use a ready-made solution.
